Easily and asynchronously apply chains of `CoreImage` filters. Pure joy.

```objective-c
- (void)processImage
{
    UIImage *img = [UIImage imageNamed:@"TestImage.jpg"];
    [self.greyscaleAndPixelate processImage:img completion:^(UIImage *result, NSError *error) {
        [self.imageView setImage:result];
    }];
}

- (IMOFilterStack *)greyscaleAndPixelate 
{
    return [IMOFilterStack withFilters:@[ [CIFilter filterWithName:@"CIPhotoEffectNoir"], 
                                          [CIFilter filterWithName:@"CIPixellate"] 
                                          ]];
}
```

## Why use IMOFilterStack?

It is cool. Less code. Reusable.

Normally you would have to repeat the following dance to process an `UIImage` using wonderful `CoreImage` filters:
- convert to `CIImage`
- setup an array of filters
- iterate through all these filters, applying them to image
- convert `CIImage` back to correct `UIImage` (either `CIImage`- or `CGImage`-backed)

`IMOFilterStack` implements all of these steps. Now all you need to do is to declaratively describe a filter chain. *A voila!* â€“ simple as that. 

## Usage

Declare a filter chain like this:

```objective-c
- (IMOFilterStack *)imageBeautifier
{
    return [IMOFilterStack withFilters:@[ [CIFilter filterWithName:@"CINoiseReduction"], 
                                          [CIFilter filterWithName:@"CIExposureAdjust" keysAndValues:kCIInputEVKey, @(0.10f), nil],
                                          [CIFilter filterWithName:@"CIVibrance" keysAndValues:@"inputAmount", @(0.10f), nil] 
                                          ]];
}
```

And use it like this:

```objective-c
[self.imageBeautifier processImage:photo completion:^(UIImage *result, NSError *error) {
    [self.handler processedPhoto:result originalPhoto:photo];
}];
```

`completion` block fires on the main thread. If you want to change that, provide your own instance of `NSOperationQueue` for callbacks.    

`IMOFilterStack` is thread-safe (some thread-safety problems with multiple instances of `CIFilter` have been reported, I haven't reproduced them yet though). `IMOFilterStack` tries to do its best, running each processing operation on a deep copy of the original filter array.

Seems to be all for now, folks. Feel free to open issues, fork and send pull requests.

Happy processing!
